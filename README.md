# Groxxy-s-HD-Texture-Pack-for-Spore

Wait a second, nobody's made a HD texture pack for spore? I suppose I should fix that...
So this page is essentially a hub for all of my HD texture mods, including my HD creature part textures from a while ago, am I boring you with text? okay I guess I can just give you the link and some screenshots.

NOTE: Low end video cards are unsupported, this mod is made for use with 1920x1080/2560x1440/3840x2160 screen resolutions.
A GTX 1060/RX 570 or higher is reccomended...
NOTE 2: Spore is a 32 bit game, this normally wouldn't be a problem, but spore is configured to only use 2gb of ram, meaning this mod WILL CAUSE YOU TO RUN OUT OF MEMORY, the only fix is using the 4gb patch on the game's executable to allow the game to use more ram. https://ntcore.com/?page_id=371
