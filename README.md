# Groxxy-s-HD-Texture-Pack-for-Spore

Wait a second, nobody's made a HD texture pack for spore? I suppose I should fix that...
So this page is essentially a hub for all of my HD texture mods, including my HD creature part textures from a while ago, am I boring you with text? okay I guess I can just give you the link and some screenshots.
NOTE: Lower end video cards are completely unsupported, this mod is made for use with 1440p-4k resolutions, At least 4 GB of VRAM is reccomended.

Reccomended Modifications & Dependancies
* = Required for full effect
*Sneky's Graphics Fix (2048x version preferrably)
*Shiny Textures fix (2048 or 4096x preferrably)
60FPS fix
My lighting overhaul mod, which is available from the spore modding community discord.
4k Resolution mod (if you have a 4k monitor)
4 GB Ram Patch (For Stability reasons) ( viewtopic.php?f=125&t=9424 )
Reshade.me (Preferrably with Marty mcfly's raytracing shader if your PC can handle it), I would also suggest using SSAA, and if you can't handle raytracing or don't have the money, use MXAO, Dithering/debanding might also help in darker areas including space.
