# Groxxy-s-HD-Texture-Pack-for-Spore

Wait a second, nobody's made a HD texture pack for spore? I suppose I should fix that...
So this page is essentially a hub for all of my HD texture mods, including my HD creature part textures from a while ago, am I boring you with text? okay I guess I can just give you the link and some screenshots.
NOTE: Lower end video cards are completely unsupported, this mod is made for use with 1440p-4k resolutions, At least 4 GB of VRAM is reccomended.
